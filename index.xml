      <description>Created a program that takes data from an employee roster excel sheet Takes data and creates 3 seperate dictionaries to populate 3 seperate excel sheets These 3 excel sheets are for Holiday/Sunday, Nighttime Overtime, and Regular Overtime By creating this program I saved myself a very very tedious task to complete at the end of the month What used to take 8 hours now takes the click of a button :)!</description>

      <description>I am currently learning by creating follow-along jupyter notebooks from experts in order to eventually (soon), take what I have learned and conduct my own study.
Some helpful notebooks I have followed along with so far&amp;hellip; https://www.kaggle.com/code/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python
-Pedro Marcelino, PHD
I completed this follow along notebook and learned the following
 We can perform log transformations to positively skewed features in order to normalize them Learned what Kurtosis means How to make correlation matrix&amp;rsquo;s (heat map style) How to create pair plots Think critically about outliers  https://www.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s all about the Journey...   I started teaching myself to program in python out of curiosity. From that initial spark of intrigue grew a fascination for machine learning and datascience. Just like learning any skill, It starts with that initial leap, that initial inevitable failure. But the important thing is to learn and maintain a passion that drives you forward to eventually succeed.</description>
