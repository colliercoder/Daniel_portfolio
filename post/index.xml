      <description>Created a program that takes data from an employee roster excel sheet Takes data and creates 3 seperate dictionaries to populate 3 seperate excel sheets These 3 excel sheets are for Holiday/Sunday, Nighttime Overtime, and Regular Overtime By creating this program I saved myself a very very tedious task to complete at the end of the month What used to take 8 hours now takes the click of a button :)!</description>
